The goal of this project is to create a RESTful API in Node.js to manage tasks, allowing users to create, update, delete, and list tasks. This API is designed to seamlessly integrate with various task management applications such as to-do lists, calendars, and more.

## Key Features

- **Task Creation:** Users can create new tasks by specifying title, description, due date, priority, and status.
- **Task Update:** Ability to mark tasks as completed, change statuses, and modify fields.
- **Task Deletion:** Elimination of tasks based on their unique ID.
- **Task Listing:** Visualization of all registered tasks, with filtering options based on different criteria.

## Technical Requirements

- The API follows RESTful principles, providing responses in JSON format.
- Proper error handling, including HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages.
- Implementation of basic authentication, such as API tokens, ensuring security and authenticity.
- Use of a database, which can be relational (e.g., MySQL) or NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).
- Clear API documentation in OpenAPI format, describing endpoints, parameters, and responses.
